# Packaged data from Zeisel (2015)
Zeisel a., Manchado a. BM, Codeluppi S, Lonnerberg P, La Manno G, Jureus A, et al. Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq. Science (80- ). 2015;347(6226):1138â€“42. 

## Description
UMI-deduplicated data, and ERCC-spike ins from Zeisel, et al 2015 (DOI: 10.1126/science.aaa1934). Wild type (CD-1) and transgenic mice (5HT3EGFP on a CD-1 background) between postnatal 21 and 31 days of both sexes were used. Somatosensory cortex or CA1 hippocampal brain regions were dissociated into a single cell suspension, ERCC and UMI added and cDNA libraries generated on Fluidigm C1. Cells were selected to be valid for analysis if they passed manual inspection of images and had more than 2500 total detected RNA molecules,  This resulted in 3315 valid cells. About 310 cells were excluded from further analysis as they clustered separately from everything else and did not express any distinct markers. Based on their expression profiles, these cells were probably neurons of low quality, resulting in 3005 remaining cells. Data was downloaded from http://linnarssonlab.org/cortex/ on 01-Feb-2017.
